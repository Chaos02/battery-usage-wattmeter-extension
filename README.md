## Description

The Battery Usage Wattmeter Extension is a GNOME extension that displays charging/discharging consumption in Watts next to the battery percentage level. It provides real-time information about your device's power usage. By default, it updates every 4 seconds and does not display consumption info when the battery is fully charged.

This extension is a fork of the [batt_consumption_wattmeter](https://github.com/wennaspeedy/batt_consumption_wattmetter) project.

## Usage

Once installed, this extension runs seamlessly in the background, and you don't need to configure any settings. It will automatically display power consumption information next to your battery percentage. Settings exist to select a specific battery and change sync interval.
